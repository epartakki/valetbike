<h1>About Us</h1>
<section>
    <p>KALES is a small team of undergraduate students, founded in January 2022. After seeing dire need for a local bike sharing app in Nipmuc Notch, our team set out with the goal of providing a new equitable method of transportation for all our users. ValetBike has an affordable, environmentally friendly option for everyone, whether you're looking for a leisure ride on the weekend or a way to work. Outside of software engineering, our team likes to play minecraft, chess, and complain. </p>
