### Recommended walkthrough steps to observe key features
- Currently, we recommend going through the following files to observe what we have attempted to set-up as we do not have functionality without errors. Our task is to solve this isssue this week, so we can continue implementing our features.

    > - `app/controllers`
    > - `app/map`
    > - `app/models`
    > - `app/views`
    > - `db/`
    > - `payment.html`

### Current error locations:
- `app/models/user.rb`
- `app/controllers/application_controller.rb`
