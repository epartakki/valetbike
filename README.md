## Description of MVP functionality

| Feature | Location | Description |
| ---- | ------ | ---------------------- |
| Sign-up | Signup Page | Users submit a form with username and password, creating a new user and saving them in the database. |
| Login | Login Page | Users submit a form with username and password, the database is queried for a user with that username. If a user is found, the password is authenticated, and a new session is created. |
| Logout | Navbar Button | Users click logout, sending a post request to the server to destroy the current session. |
| Map | Map Page | An interactive leaflet map is rendered with markers for each station. Station data displays when users select a marker, which is queried from the database. |
| Google translate | Footer | Users select preferred language using a google drop down button, and the site translates into that language. |
| Payment connection | Payment Page | Users redirect to their Paypal or Venmo login after selecting their preferred membership. |
